## 🚀 How to Complete Setup

### Step 1: Create Missing Views Folder

2. Navigate to: Final_Project_Group_10\Final_Project_Group_10\Views\
3. Create new folder: Rooms
```

### Step 2: Create View Files
Refer to the code I provided earlier in the conversation. You need to create:

1. **Index.cshtml** - Copy the code for rooms listing
2. **Details.cshtml** - Copy the code for room details
3. **Create.cshtml** - Copy the code for create form

### Step 3: Build and Test
```bash
cd "C:\Users\user\Desktop\Class server\Final_Project_Group_10\Final_Project_Group_10"
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

Then visit:
- `https://localhost:5001` - Homepage
- `https://localhost:5001/Rooms` - Rooms list
- `https://localhost:5001/Rooms/Details/1` - Room details

### Step 4: Git Setup (if not done)
Follow the instructions in **GIT_INSTRUCTIONS.md**

1. Git commits (git log --oneline)
2. Git branches (git branch)
3. GitHub repository page
4. Project running in browser
5. Solution Explorer in Visual Studio

## 📊 Current vs. Final Architecture

### Current (Milestone 1) ✅
```
User → Browser → ASP.NET MVC → RoomsController → Sample Data → View
```

### Next Milestone (Entity Framework) 🔄
```
User → Browser → ASP.NET MVC → RoomsController → DbContext → SQL Server → View
```

### Future (Full System) 🎯
```
User → Auth → ASP.NET MVC → Controllers → Services → DbContext → SQL Server
                                     ↓
                              Email Service
                              Validation
                              Business Logic
```
